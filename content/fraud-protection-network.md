# AI and insights from the fraud protection network

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection assesses a transaction’s likelihood of fraud using Microsoft’s industry-leading AI platform. This platform leverages transactional data to train machine learning models and detect linkages of fraud happening across all merchants in the fraud protection network.

Participating in this network enables you to derive insights from the collective experience of other merchants who use Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, and can help your business tackle emerging fraud vectors.

## Participation and privacy

Joining the fraud protection network through use of the Evaluate and Protect experiences of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection requires sharing selected data. To protect the privacy of participating businesses and their customers, any data utilized by the network is always in the form of one of the following:

- **Derived features of attributes of entities**. A plain text address would never be shared, for example, but the knowledge that it represents a post office box might be. These derivations cannot be reverse engineered to reveal the original values. 
- **Irreversibly hashed tokens of entities**. Tokenization ensures that the fraud protection network can build up linkage information without storing the explicit details of the entities. This protects both customer and merchant privacy.

The fraud protection network is owned and controlled exclusively by Microsoft, and is equipped with top-notch security and compliance capabilities. Participation in the fraud protection network does not reveal your data to other merchants or external entities, and no merchant can exploit business intelligence from any other merchant for competitive purchases. Only Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection and device fingerprinting applications that are explicitly devoted to fraud protection have access to the network.

For more information about how your data is protected, see [Data security and compliance](security-compliance.md).
