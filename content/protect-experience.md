# Protect experience

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection's *Protect experience* builds on the features of the Evaluate experience by embedding Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection into your full production environment, where it becomes your real-time risk decision tool for fraud protection. You can take advantage of model scores to decide whether to accept or reject transactions, adjudicate escalations from customers, and share relevant information about transaction trustworthiness with participating banks and issuers to help boost their acceptance rates.

## Dashboard

Your dashboard keeps you up to date about useful information, essential tasks that you need to complete, and important settings that you should configure to get the most out of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. Critical steps are marked to indicate your current setup status. Steps might be marked as **Completed** or **Not started**, or they might show the number of items that still remain.
