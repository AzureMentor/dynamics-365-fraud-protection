# Protect experience

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection offers multiple experiences to introduce you to the product and accelerate your journey to full production.

You can take advantage of model scores to decide whether to accept or reject transactions, adjudicate escalations from customers, and share relevant information about transaction trustworthiness with banks and issuers to help boost their acceptance rates.
