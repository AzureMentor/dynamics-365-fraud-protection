# Data processing and protection

Fraud protection is a knowledge-intensive task. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection (DFP) processes data about online payment transactions, online account activities, and devices interacting with DFP customers' ecommerce properties to help: 

- prevent and identify fraudulent payment transactions;  
- discern legitimate transactions to drive down “false positives;” and 
- improve its customers’ online shopping experience.  

Designed with compliance, security, confidentiality, and privacy in mind, DFP uses machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data de-identification techniques to evaluate payment transactions and certain account activities for risk and provide customers insights about the health of their ecommerce business.    

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft is not a consumer reporting agency. The fraud insights generated by Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection are not intended to be credit reports. Your use of DFP is subject to the use restrictions detailed in the Microsoft Online Services Terms.

## What data does DFP process?  

DFP processes three types of customer data to provide the service:  

- **Payment Transaction Data**. This is information about our customer’s online payment transactions (past and present). Payment Transaction Data can include the email and shipping address associated with a payment transaction, as well as the outcome of a payment transaction, such as a chargeback. DFP does not collect full payment instrument details, such as complete credit card number.      
- **Account Activity Data**. This is information associated with our customer’ end users’ account activities (past and present), such as requests to create a new customer account or updates to an existing customer account. 
- **Device Data**. This is information about the devices visiting our customer’s ecommerce properties.  

Both Payment Transaction Data and Account Activity Data are provided to DFP by customers two ways: 

- Customers use the DFP API to transmit data associated with real-time payment transactions or account activities; and  
- Customers upload data about past payment transaction and account activities to the service. 

Device Data is collected and transmitted to DFP when a customer installs a device fingerprinting script into their ecommerce properties which instructs DFP to collect data on its behalf from devices visiting the customer’s ecommerce properties. 

## How does DFP process this data?  

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection processes the customer data described above for the sole purpose of providing the service, which includes generating fraud insights from deidentified data from all DFP customers within the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection Network (the “Fraud Network”).  

### DFP enriches and normalizes customer data.  

Payment Transaction Data, Account Activity Data, and Device Data are enriched and normalized to aid the service’s application of machine learning and artificial intelligence. For example:

- Transaction amount is converted into US dollars using the current exchange rate;  
- Addresses, such as the billing or shipping address associated with a transaction, are converted into a canonical format. For example, "One Microsoft Wy" may become "1 Microsoft Way.” 
- Device Data collected from a single device is converted to a fuzzy identifier.  

### DFP de-identifies customer data to be processed in the Fraud Network.  

DFP hashes the customer data, which includes personal data, to de-identify it prior to transmitting into the Dynamics 365 Fraud Network where it is processed to generate fraud insights. The hashing technique used by DFP turns customer data into unique de-identified tokens and serves the following purposes:

The technique produces the same output for an input (it’s reproducible). The de-identification technique, which uses a salt specific to the Fraud Network and unique salts for each customer, ensures the same input value always maps to the same output token. For example, the email address “JohnDoe@outlook.com” will always map to “TK239732” (say) when the salt specific to the Fraud Network is used, no matter which customer provides the input and at what point in time. This property enables DFP to identify patterns of fraud, and make connections between tokens, across all customers of DFP within the Fraud Network. By processing customer data with a unique salt only assigned to one customer, DFP is also able to provide customers with information about their own patterns of fraud, as DFP can make connections between tokens for a single customer.  

The technique produces (practically) a one-to-one mapping. Although the hashing technique is technically not a one-is-to-one mapping for any given salt, the probability that two distinct input values will result in the same de-deidentified output value (called a “hash collision”) is vanishingly small. This means that for practical purposes we can rely on the connections made between the tokens, even while they are de-identified.  

The technique is practically irreversible. This process makes it practically impossible to reverse engineer a deidentified attribute (token) back to the original input, identify a data subject from the tokens, or otherwise “rehydrate” the customer data without access to the hash function and the salt.  Reversing engineering the technique to rehydrate the data, and render it identifiable, would require a highly sophisticated, brute force attack. 

The technique gives customers added assurance that their Customer Data will not be shared with other DFP customers.  The deidentified tokens in the Fraud Network cannot be linked to any specific DFP customer without access to the hash function, salt and raw data in that customer’s merchant space and a then a brute force attack.  

### DFP applies machine learning and artificial intelligence to the tokens in the Fraud Network to generate fraud insights for DFP customers.  

DFP uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand patterns of fraud which enables the service to generate fraud insights for new real-time payment transactions and account activities for customers. These fraud insights include a risk score for the real-time event and reason codes for the score.  For example, within the Fraud Network, DFP may detect a suspiciously high volume of payment transactions, within a very short period of time, associated with a particular token (which could represent a billing address or IP Address). If DFP detects that token in new, real-time payment transactions, it may provide the customer with a higher risk score and a reason code that indicates that DFP has detected a suspiciously high volume of transactions for a data attribute associated with the transaction.   

### DFP processes customer data in accordance with business rules set by the customer.                  

Customers can set business rules within DFP to automate its own analysis of a real-time transaction or account event, taking into account the risk score and reason codes. For example, in addition to the fraud insights provided by DFP, customers apply their own business rules to approve a payment transaction based on any number of factors, including the transaction amount, the payment instrument used, or the content of the order. Each customer’s business rules are treated as customer confidential information and customer data. DFP will process such data on behalf of the customer, in accordance with the business rules set, to make a recommendation on accepting or rejecting the transaction or event.  

### DFP enables customers to share Transaction Trust Knowledge with participating banks.  

Customers can choose to use the Transaction Acceptance Booster by opting into the feature. This feature allows customers to share certain customer data, called Transaction Trust Knowledge, with participating banks when a payment transaction is initiated with a payment instrument issued by the participating bank. Transaction Trust Knowledge is a small payload of customer data and includes: 

- an ordinal variable generated by DFP that represents DFP’s risk assessment of the transaction;   
- the latitude-longitude (up to first decimal precision) representing the geolocation of the transaction initiator; 
- a device identifier associated with the transaction initiator;  
- the bank identification number (“BIN”);
- the last four digits of the payment card used in the transaction; and 
- the transaction amount.   

By opting into this feature, a customer directs DFP to transmit Transaction Trust Knowledge on its behalf to a participating bank when a payment transaction is initiated on the customer’s ecommerce property with a payment card issued by such bank. For any given payment transaction, a customer’s Transaction Trust Knowledge is only shared with the participating bank when a payment card issued by that bank is used to initiate that payment transaction.  

The Transaction Trust Knowledge is processed by participating banks in accordance with its agreements with a customer and applicable network rules.  

### DFP processes customer data to provide tools, such as graphical reports, to surface business intelligence related to fraud.  

DFP uses customer data to provide tools to help customers understand how fraud is impacting its ecommerce business. Such tools include reporting functionality, graphical displays, and support services features.  

## How does DFP secure customer data? 

Microsoft, in providing Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect customer data, which includes personal data. Those measures shall be set forth in a Microsoft Security Policy. Microsoft will make that policy available to customers, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, and other information reasonably requested by the customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies. 

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection complies with, and has been successfully audited against, the requirements set forth in ISO 27001, ISO 27002, and ISO 27018.  

## Can I use DFP in compliance with my requirements? 

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind and is only intended to be used to prevent fraud and help identify legitimate payment transactions. Microsoft offers DFP under the Microsoft Online Services Terms, which includes robust Data Protection Terms.
