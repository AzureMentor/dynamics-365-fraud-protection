# Privacy

Fraud protection is a knowledge-intensive task. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection processes data about payment transactions, online account activities, and devices interacting with Fraud Protection customers' ecommerce properties to help: 

- Prevent and identify fraudulent payment transactions.  
- Discern legitimate transactions to drive down “false positives”. 
- Improve customers’ online shopping experience.  

Designed with compliance, security, confidentiality, and privacy in mind, Fraud Protection uses machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data de-identification techniques to evaluate payment transactions, certain account activities, and other events for risk and provides customers insights about the health of their commerce operations.

Your use of Fraud Protection is subject to the use restrictions detailed in the Microsoft Online Services Terms.

## What data does Fraud Protection process?  

Fraud Protection processes three types of Customer Data to provide the service:  

- **Payment Transaction Data**. This is information about our customer’s online payment transactions (past and present). For example, Payment Transaction Data can include:

  - The transaction amount and information about the goods contained in the order. 
  - The name, email, shipping address, and other geo-location information associated with a payment transaction. 
  - The outcome of a payment transaction, such as a chargeback.
   - information about the payment instrument (though, Fraud Protectio does not collect full payment instrument details, such as complete credit card number).      

- **Account Activity Data**. This is information associated with our customer’s end users’ account activities (past and present), such as requests to create a new customer account or updates to an existing customer account. Account Activity Data may include:

  - Device attributes such as plugins installed, processor class etc. 
  - Operating system attributes, such as OS Information. 
  - Browser related attributes if applicable such as browser language, font etc.
