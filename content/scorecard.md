# Learn from the scorecard

The scorecard reports provide a review of your key metrics and can help you understand the month-by-month performance of your fraud protection efforts.

In the Evaluate experience, your scorecard lets you evaluate the capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. In the Protect experience, you can monitor the real-time performance of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection as your system of record. To evaluate specific ranges of data in detail, you can filter and pivot the scorecards on predefined attributes, markets, and product categories. You can then use the knowledge that you gain to make well-informed risk management decisions for your business.

Your top-four key performance indicators (KPIs) are summarized across the top of the page to provide a snapshot of your performance. You can fully investigate these metrics in the charts.

## Customize your view

To filter your view of the interactive charts, use the drop-down menus and sliders. The following options are available:

- **Aggregation level** – Show a daily, weekly, or monthly view of your data.
- **MID classification** – Show all program merchant IDs (MIDs) and/or standard MIDs.
- **Assessment type** – Show the assessments that were made in the Evaluate or Protect experience.
- **Merchant decision** – Show approval and/or rejection decisions that were the result of your settings in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.
- **Current purchase status** – Show the latest status of the purchase.
- **User country** – Show one, multiple, or all countries or regions.
- **Product category** – Show one, multiple, or all product categories.
- **Transaction date** – Show transaction data by date. You can select dates in the calendar, enter them manually, or select ranges of dates.

To clear previous selections, hover over the category name, and then select the Clear selections icon (the eraser symbol). Note that one value must be selected for the **Aggregation level** option.

## KPI charts

The scorecard plots the following metrics:

- **Transaction volume** – The total count of transactions that were sent for assessment.
- **Approved rate** – The percentage of purchases that were approved out of the total volume.
- **Rejected rate** – The percentage of purchases that were rejected out of the total volume.
- **Settled rate** – The percentage of bank approvals out of the total volume that was sent to banks.
- **Chargeback rate** – The percentage of chargebacks out of the total volume that was approved by banks on the chargeback receipt date and the transaction date.
- **Refund rate** – The percentage of refunds out of the total volume that was approved by banks.
