# Learn from the scorecard

Use the scorecard reports to review your key metrics and understand the month-by-month performance of your fraud protection. 
In the Evaluate experience, your scorecard enables you to evaluate the capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. In Protect, monitor the real-time performance of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection as your system of record. To evaluate specific ranges of data in detail, filter and pivot the scorecards on pre-defined attributes, markets, and product categories. This knowledge can be leveraged to make well-informed risk management decisions for your business. 

## Customize your view 
Your top four key performance indicators (KPIs) are summarized across the top of the screen, providing a snapshot of your performance. These metrics can be fully investigated in the charts that follow.

Use the dropdowns and sliders as desired to customize your view of the interactive charts. Options include the following: 

- **Aggregation level**: Show a daily, weekly, or monthly view of your data. 
- **MID classification**: Show all program merchant IDs (MIDs) and/or standard MIDs. 
- **Assessment type**: Show the assessments made within the Evaluate or Protect experiences. 
- **Merchant decision**: Show approval and/or rejection decisions that resulted from the merchant's settings in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. 
- **Current purchase status**: Show the latest status of the purchase. 
- **User country**: Show one, multiple, or all countries. 
- **Product category**: Show one, multiple, or all defined product categories. 
- **Transaction date**: Show transaction data by date. You can select dates from the calendar, enter them manually, or choose ranges with the slider.

To clear previous selections, hover over the category name and select the eraser icon to the right. Note that Aggregation level must have one value selected.
