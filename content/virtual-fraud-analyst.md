# Use the virtual fraud analyst

Using innovative AI technology, the virtual fraud analyst provides a compelling view of your historical data in each segment and helps you set up and adjust the optimal risk score thresholds. This information can then be transformed into rules enabling you to make appropriate accept or reject decisions on your customer transactions.

## Recommendations

The machine learning models in the fraud protection network help find emerging fraud patterns and risky cohorts across all participating merchants. The virtual fraud analyst can leverage these findings and make recommendations to all Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection merchants about improving the configuration of their rules. The virtual fraud analyst also makes recommendations for how to augment existing data by adding additional attributes and information into the knowledge graph (for example, chargeback data, margins, and COGS) to maximize the impact of the product.

## Balance fraud loss versus opportunity loss

The goal of any world-class fraud protection system is to enable companies to optimize their bottom line. Using Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you can quickly find a risk threshold to help balance fraud protection while keeping the impact to your legitimate transactions at comfortably low levels.
