# Overview

Today's digitally transformed enterprise conducts most of its business online and in real time. Little human intervention is involved. Although this approach helps reduce costs and improve the customer experience, it also exposes the enterprise to serious threats of fraud from sophisticated users who try to take advantage of the online channel's relative anonymity and accessibility. For example, in e-commerce, some transactions are maliciously created via compromised accounts and stolen payment instruments. Other malicious activities that users might try include account takeover, abuse of free trials, fake product reviews, warranty fraud, refund fraud, reseller fraud, abuse of program discounts. All these activities, and others, can affect the enterprise's profitability and reputation.

Some types of fraud even have serious consequences for society at large. Examples include money laundering and posting fake news.

Because the return on investment (ROI) for online fraud is high, it's likely that most of an enterprise's vulnerabilities will be discovered and exploited. Additionally, unlike during the early years of the internet, today's fraudulent transactions can be orchestrated by well-funded and well-equipped rings of professionals. Fraud protection professionals are best equipped to fight this threat.

*Our mission is to help digitally transformed enterprises fight fraud while they keep their doors open for genuine customers and partners.*

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection focuses on payment fraud protection and related scenarios in e-commerce. It helps e-commerce merchants drive down fraud loss, increase bank acceptance rates to yield higher revenue, and improve the online shopping experience for its customers.

Microsoft has many years of experience protecting our own e-commerce businesses from fraud. We have developed a sophisticated technology stack that uses connected big data across multiple lines of business and applies cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) to help provide more accurate decisions in real time. We have core differentiators, such as device fingerprinting, operations research, a fraud protection network, and a trust knowledge exchange with banks.

By using Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you can help protect your business from fraud through several innovative and advanced capabilities. Here are some examples: 

- [AI and insights from the fraud protection network](fraud-protection-network.md)
- A [rules engine](lists-model-operating-points.md) and [virtual fraud analyst](virtual-fraud-analyst.md)
- A [graph explorer](graph-explorer.md) and [scorecard](scorecard.md)
- A [transaction acceptance booster](transaction-acceptance-booster.md)

These capabilities are part of a comprehensive set of features that are grouped into three user experiences to help accelerate your journey toward a more comprehensive fraud protection environment: 

- **Diagnose** – Use this experience in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection to gain insights into fraud issues in your environment.
- **Evaluate** – Use this guided experience to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection relative to your current fraud protection solution.
