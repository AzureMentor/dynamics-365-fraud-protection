# Overview

Today’s digitally transformed enterprise conducts most of its business online and in real time with little human intervention. This reduces costs and improves the customer experience, but it also exposes the enterprise to serious threats of fraud from sophisticated users who attempt to take advantage of the online channel’s relative anonymity and accessibility. For example, in eCommerce, some transactions are created maliciously via compromised accounts and stolen payment instruments. Other nefarious activities like account takeover, free trial abuse, fake product reviews, warranty fraud, refund fraud, reseller fraud, abuse of program discounts, and many more can be attempted—all of which impact the enterprise’s profitability and reputation. Some types of fraud even have grave consequences to society at large. Examples include laundering money and posting fake news. Because the ROI for online fraud is high, it is likely that most vulnerabilities of an enterprise will be discovered and exploited. Moreover, unlike during the nascent years of the internet, today’s fraudulent transactions can be orchestrated by well-funded and well-equipped rings of professionals. Fraud protection professionals are best equipped to fight this menace.

*Our mission is to help digitally transformed enterprises fight fraud while keeping their doors open for genuine customers and partners.*

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection will initially focus on payment fraud protection and related scenarios in eCommerce. It will help enable an eCommerce merchant to drive down fraud loss, increase bank acceptance rates to yield higher revenue, and improve the online shopping experience of its customers. Microsoft has many years of experience protecting our own eCommerce businesses from fraud. We have developed a sophisticated technology stack that uses connected big data across multiple lines of business and applies cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) to help provide more accurate decisions in real time. We have core differentiators, such as device fingerprinting, operations research, a fraud protection network, and a trust knowledge exchange with banks.

Using Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you can help protect your business from fraud using innovative and advanced capabilities, including: 

- [Artificial intelligence and insights from the fraud protection network](fraud-protection-network.md)

- A [rules engine](lists-model-operating-points.md) and [virtual fraud analyst](virtual-fraud-analyst.md) 

- [Graph explorer](graph-explorer.md) and [scorecard](scorecard.md)

- [Transaction acceptance booster](transaction-acceptance-booster.md)

These are part of a comprehensive set of features grouped into three user experiences that will accelerate your journey into full production.
