# Usage metering

Metering provides an overview of your usage of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. You can view statistics about different API types over time and filter your view to highlight specific data and date ranges as needed. When your billing for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection begins, you can use this information to assess any impact to your costs. Data on the Metering page is refreshed on an hourly basis.

The Metering page breaks out information into three tabs. **Assessment APIs** include the APIs that return a risk score assessment, like Purchase and Signup. **Data update APIs** include the APIs that update information but do not return a risk assessment. **Other events** contains additional APIs that help power tools like the graph explorer, risk support, and device fingerprinting.

Each tab shows usage charts and statistics for the APIs represented in that category. You can select specific date ranges, types of APIs, and the specific Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection experience youâ€™re using to filter these charts.

Counts appear under **Total API responses**. These include both successful and unsuccessful API responses. The charts illustrate the numbers of successful and unsuccessful calls to the specified API during your selected time period. To view one set or the other individually, select **Success** or **Bad request**. To drill in and view specific data with more granularity, use the controls in the upper right of each chart.
